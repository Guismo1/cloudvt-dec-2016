# Step 1 - Access to Terraform

In order to perform the functions of the Terraform lab you will first need access to Terraform.  You can accomplish this in one of 2 ways.

## Option 1 - Use the jumpbox provided

We have provided a jumpbox with Terraform pre-installed as well as a clone of the repository, sample contents, etc.  Use the information below to gain access:

> Login - get from session instructor
> Password - get from session instructor
> IP Address - 199.66.189.253

For Mac / Linux users - ssh <username>@199.66.189.253
For Windows users - use putty or similar terminal emulator

_There are no ssh keys required from access to the jumpbox, ssh password auth is available, be courteous of your neighbors : )_
